# Practical PyTorch

Learn PyTorch with project-based tutorials. So far they are focused on applying recurrent neural networks to natural language tasks.

These tutorials aim to:

* Acheive specific goals with minimal parts
* Demonstrate modern techniques with common data
* Use low level but low complexity models
* Reach for readablity over efficiency

## Tutorials

* [Classifying Names with a Character-Level RNN](https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch/blob/master/char-rnn-classification/char-rnn-classification.ipynb)
* [Generating Names with a Character-Level RNN](https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch/blob/master/char-rnn-generation/char-rnn-generation.ipynb)
* *WIP* Translation with Sequence to Sequence Networks
* *TODO* Intent parsing with Sequence to Sequence Networks and Attention
